This is the official github repository for the THC, a pentesting tool created by Ernest Anguera e Isaac Le√≥n.
### What is this tool?
THC is a cracking station which allows its users to find vulnerabilities inside a system in order to make that device safer by knowing its weaknesses.\
Under no circumstance it is designed to make a profit.

### How can you access the tool?
In order to connect to your Terrible Hackiemos Crackt00l, you will need to follow the next instructions:
1. Once the tool is connected to a device via USB, a Virtual Net, will be created. Once this Net is running, you can either user your computer or mobile phone to connect via Wifi.
2. You can connect via Wifi, or if you are configuring it, you can access from the computer itself:

    1. If you want to access via the same computer where the tool is conected, just search on the browser the following address: [```http://172.16.0.1```](http://172.16.0.1)

    2. When you are connected to the wifi, you will not have internet access, but if you search on the web browser the following address: [```http://172.24.0.1```](http://172.24.0.1) , you will access the web interface of the THC cracktool.
